        "This is a Jupyter Notebook, a web interface that can run live code (in this case Python3), display text, and run other visualizations.  It allows us to build a much richer experience working through computational models.  Best of all: the code runs on the server.  No installing software!  No downloading code!  No VPN!\n",

        "### A: \n",
        "Good question. The purpose of these simulations isn't really to learn the math, or understand the capabilities of a technique like in sessions past (think: Machine Learning...). For that reason, we looked into a more visual way to work with these models. As a bonus, we can bypass all the klunkiness of having you download zip folders of code and troubleshooting software installs.\n",

Also, the code is live, so you can tweak and run it as you want to get an even better understanding of how these complex organ models work.  People who use Jupyter Notebooks in the real world often use these notebooks to collaborate, document, and develop new tools, techniques and more. \n",

Run a cell by clicking it once so it highlights in blue.  Then click \"Run\".  Start at the top and work your way down.  The first set of code containing cells have functions used by all the rest of the code. Later on, we start graphing the output.  Each cell with a graph includes **All** the parameters used in the simulation, so you can change them wherever; no need to scroll around looking for a variable. If you do change variables or other code in a cell, you need to re-run that cell and any others that use that cell for it to update. That's it!   \n",

Shorter timescales (.001-.002) will cause the insulin levels to track very closely with glucose levels, as if there is an instantaneous metabolic reaction time.\n",

        "> After an overnight fast, the liver plays a primary role in maintaining blood glucose by producing glucose at the same rate at which it is used by resting tissues. Glucose uptake and use occur predominantly in tissues that do not require insulin for glucose uptake, such as the brain. Hepatic glucose output is stimulated by glucagon and is primarily a result of glycogenolysis, which can provide, on average, an 8-hour supply of glucose. The low levels of insulin present (basal secretion of 0.25–1.0 unit/h) are insufficient to block the release of fatty acids from fat, which provide fuel for muscles (fatty acid oxidation) and substrate for hepatic ketogenesis. However, these levels of insulin are sufficient to prevent excessive lipolysis, ketogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, thus preventing hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.\n",

If we define diabetes as *\"...a persistent hyperglycemia...\"* [1 Topp et al](#Bibligraphy \"Go To Bib\"), there are several ways we could induce that chronic condition in our model. The paper explores three main ways diabetes could manifest: **Regulated Hyperglycemia**, **Bifurcation**, and **Dynamical Hyperglycemia**. We'll walk through each mechanism, then model the described phenomena by simply changing parameter values in the code to see what affect they have on the system as a whole.
